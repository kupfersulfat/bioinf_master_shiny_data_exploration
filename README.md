# shiny_data_exploration

This is a shiny web application for interactive exploratory data analysis of the R built-in datasets "swiss", "LakeHuron", "Titanic" and the "state.x77" dataset from the e1071 package.

The app.R file is the main file containing the ui skeleton and the server part. The other four files contain the ui for their corresponding tab.
